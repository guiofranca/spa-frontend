## Purpose
This project is made to practice my developer skills using [PHP](https://github.com/php)/[Laravel](https://github.com/laravel) for the API and [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs)/[Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt) for the Web Pages and Single Page Application feel.

Also to make my home's bill splitting easier. It was previously done by registering the expenses on a Google form, and the splitting calculated on a Spreadsheet.
